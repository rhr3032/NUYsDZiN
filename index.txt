About me

I'm a Creative UI/UX Designer from Patuakhali, BD, with 4+ years of experience. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

My job/passion is to Design your Website's User Interface, so that it is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive. Moreover, I add personal touch to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use.
My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way. I created web design and their ui design for many famous brand companies.

DON'T BE SHY!
Feel free to get in touch with me. I am always open to discussing new projects, creative ideas or opportunities to be part of your visions.
